听说google出了在线翻译的工具，而且还广受大家的好评，在美国举行的一次翻译比赛中还拿了冠军。我虽不是google的粉丝但也对google的产品挺感兴趣的，于是赶紧凑个热闹，看看伟大的google能不能给我带来惊喜。
    由于我只会中文，那就看看google的英译中的水平怎么样。废话少说，赶紧拿来一首英文歌词《you needed me》（我最喜欢的英文歌曲之一）。

You needed me

I cries a tear you wiped it dry

I was confused you cleared my mind

I sold my soul you bought it back for me

And help me up and give me dignity

Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again

To face the world out on my own again

You put me high upon a pedestal

So high that I could almost see eternity

You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true

I needed you and you were there

And I'll never leave why should I leave

I'd be a fool

Cause I've finally found someone

Who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold

When I lost you took me home

You gave me hope when I was at the end

And turned my lies back into truth again

You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again

To face the world out on my own again

You put me high upon a pedestal

So high that I could almost see eternity

You needed me ,you needed me

Oh, yes, you need me

You needed me

先试了一下整段翻译,把歌词复制进去,出来的结果让我忍俊不禁

google自动翻译的文字：

你需要我,我喊了眼泪,你擦它干,我摸你清我心中我卖出 我的灵魂,你买回来,我和帮助我,让我有点尊严,你需要我你们给了我力量单独再次面对世界走出自己再次你就把我小时 在室内一个台阶那么高,我几乎可以看到永恒,你需要我,多欧需要我,我也不相信是你,我不能相信这是真的,我需要你和你的笔 在此,我永远不会离开,我为何要离开我就是一个傻瓜,我的事业总算发现有人真的三白族你握着我的手,当它冷时,我输了,你带我家,你给了我希望钨 母鸡,我是在年底把我的谎言放回真话的时候,你甚至骂我的朋友,你克须缴我力量单独再次面对世界走出自己再次你就把我高美 无源一个台阶那么高,我几乎可以看到永恒,你需要我,你需要我哦,多 欧需要我,你需要我
